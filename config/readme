- Place all your configuration customization files in this directory
    - feel free to edit the included recommended files
    - files here override container settings including nginx.conf
- Files here are placed in the HTTP configuration context
- ONLY files that end with '.conf' will be processed!
    - if you want to keep a file for reference or disable it temporarily, 
        simply change the extension.  I like using '.conf.disabled'.
- If you don't want to use this directory or these settings, you can bind-mount 
  any other directory you want to '/etc/nginx/config/'
