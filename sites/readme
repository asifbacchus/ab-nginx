- Place all your server block configuration files in this directory
- This path should be bind-mounted to the container at:
  '/etc/nginx/sites'
    - this bind-mount will override the test pages included in the container by 
        default.
- All files should begin in the 'server' configuration context
- ONLY files that end with '.conf' will be processed!
    - if you want to keep a file for reference or disable it temporarily, 
        simply change the extension.  I like using '.conf.disabled'.
- If you don't want to use this directory, you can bind-mount any other 
  directory you want to '/etc/nginx/sites/'
